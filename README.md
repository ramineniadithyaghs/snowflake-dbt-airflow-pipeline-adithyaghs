A production-grade ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) data pipeline that processes millions of records using modern data stack best practices. This project demonstrates enterprise-scale data engineering with Snowflake, dbt, and Apache Airflow.
📊 Architecture Overview
Show Image
Pipeline Flow

Extract: Raw data from TPCH orders table (Snowflake sample database)
Load: Ingest into Snowflake data warehouse
Transform: dbt models create staging, intermediate, and mart layers
Orchestrate: Airflow DAGs automate the entire workflow
Test: Automated data quality checks ensure integrity


🎯 Key Features
✅ Modular dbt Project

Source definitions and documentation
Staging models for raw data cleaning
Intermediate models for business logic
Fact tables and data marts for analytics
Custom macros (e.g., discount price calculations)

✅ Comprehensive Testing

Generic tests (uniqueness, not_null, relationships)
Singular tests for business logic validation
Schema validation and data quality checks

✅ Production-Ready Orchestration

Airflow DAGs with retry logic
Task dependencies and error handling
Scheduled runs and monitoring

✅ Best Practices

Medallion architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold)
DRY principles with dbt macros
Version control and CI/CD ready
Clear documentation and lineage

🧪 Data Quality & Testing
This project includes comprehensive testing:
Generic Tests:

Uniqueness checks on primary keys
Not-null validation on required fields
Referential integrity between tables
Accepted value ranges

Singular Tests:

Custom business logic validation
Cross-model consistency checks
Revenue calculation accuracy

Run tests:
bashdbt test

📈 Key Transformations

Source Layer (sources.yml)

Defines raw TPCH orders table
Documents data lineage


Staging Layer (stg_orders.sql)

Cleans raw data
Standardizes column names
Applies data types


Intermediate Layer (int_orders_enhanced.sql)

Business logic calculations
Uses custom macros (discount pricing)
Aggregations and joins


Mart Layer (fct_orders.sql)

Analytics-ready fact table
Optimized for BI tool consumption
Pre-aggregated metrics

🔄 Airflow Orchestration
The pipeline is automated with Airflow:
DAG Features:

✅ Scheduled daily runs
✅ Automatic retries on failure
✅ Email alerts for errors
✅ Task dependencies ensure correct execution order
✅ SLA monitoring

Start Airflow:
bashairflow db init
airflow webserver --port 8080
airflow scheduler

💡 Use Cases
This pipeline architecture can be adapted for:

E-commerce Analytics - Order processing and customer insights
Financial Reporting - Transaction data transformation
Supply Chain - Inventory and logistics tracking
Marketing Analytics - Campaign performance measurement

🎓 What I Learned
Building this project taught me:
✅ Modern data stack best practices (Snowflake + dbt + Airflow)
✅ Incremental model design for performance
✅ Data testing and validation strategies
✅ Workflow orchestration and error handling
✅ Documentation and maintainability principles

🔮 Future Enhancements
Planned improvements
 Add dbt docs generation (dbt docs generate)
 Implement incremental models for large datasets
 Add data quality monitoring with Great Expectations
 CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
 Snowflake cost optimization (clustering, materialization)
 Integration with BI tools (Tableau/Power BI)
